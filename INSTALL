Building Sexcoin

See doc/readme-qt.rst for instructions on building sexcoin-QT,
the intended-for-end-users, nice-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of sexcoin.

See doc/build-*.txt for instructions on building sexcoind,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of sexcoin.


Installing Sexcoin:

Set up a directory for the binaries ( Linux: I usually do ~/apps/sexcoin )

QT Versions support sound events:

Sound support will support any type of sound file that you have a codec available for.
Copy the 'Sounds' directory into the main program directory.
To enable custom sounds, copy the sound file into the Sounds directory and restart your client.
Use the 'options|sounds' dialog to adjust sounds to your liking.
